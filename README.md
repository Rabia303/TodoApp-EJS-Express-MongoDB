Objective: Create a small application where users can add, view, and delete tasks. Use EJS for the frontend, Express for handling server requests, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database.


Sample Data:

const sampleTasks = [
    { name: "Buy groceries" },
    { name: "Complete Node.js project" },
    { name: "Prepare for the meeting" },
    { name: "Call the plumber" },
    { name: "Read a new book" }
];
